  <p>Wield the elements as a Warden, a brand new class for 5th Edition.<br /><br /> The Warden brings to 5th Edition a powerful mix of martial and magical prowess, influenced by nature
    and the world around them. <br /><br /> Use <b>Natural Power</b>, a frequently recharging pool of dice to add elemental damage and effects to you attacks. <br /><br /> Choose your <b>Discipline</b>: the Guardian, the Fanatic, the Sage, or the
    Dragon Guard. Each will determine your role in combat and shape how your character interacts with the world around them. <br /><br /> Cast brand new <b>elemental spells</b> which recharge on Short Rest to bolster your fighting prowess or subdue
    foes from a distance. <br /><br /> Upon reaching 3rd level, you access your <b>Prime Element</b>, one of five paths to choose from: Erupting Earth, Flaming Bravery, Stoic Chill, Unrelenting Storm, or Putrid Corrosion. Learn new cantrips based on
    these elements, as well as special attacks and effects. <br /><br /> As you grow stronger, you develop a deeper connection to the elements, and the world in which you live. The <b>Warden Class</b> has been in development and playtesting for over
    4 years, and this is the definitive version, ready for your game!</p>
