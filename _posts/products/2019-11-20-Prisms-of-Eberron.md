### Five Eberron Subclasses for the best selling Prism class!
The Prism bring a unique gameplay experience to the table. A prism has a pool of **influence** that restores at the start of each turn in combat, and increases in size steadily as they level. This influence is the fuel for their basic actions - called Projections - each turn and can be spent while using a projection to alter the emotional state of a target. This is done to both punish enemies and to bolster allies.

#### Prisms of Eberron

Contained herein are lore and rules for playing the <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?discount=9c15029202&affiliate_id=1713687">*Prism*</a> class in the Eberron campaign setting created by Keith Baker and Wizards of the Coast.

The prism brings a unique gameplay experience to the table. A prism has a pool of **influence** that restores at the start of each turn in combat, and increases in size steadily as they level. This influence is the fuel for their basic actions—called Projections—each turn and can be spent while using a projection to alter the emotional state of a target. This is done to both punish enemies and to bolster allies. A prism’s magic is focused on the manipulation of light, energy, and emotions.

**Prisms of Eberron** introduces five new subclasses based on the kalashtar, a race descended from human monks who bonded with extraplanar creatures known as the quori.

- **Du'ulora:** A warlord with twin weapons: fire and rage.
- **Hashalaq:** A beguiling empath who avoids direct conflict.
- **Kalaraq:** Rulers of nightmare.
- **Tsoreva:** Wields mindblades of pure light.
- **Tsucora:** Fear incarnate.
