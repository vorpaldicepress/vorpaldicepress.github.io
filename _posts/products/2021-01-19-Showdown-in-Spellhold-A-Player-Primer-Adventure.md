Off the coast of Amn lies Spellhold, a long-abandoned magical asylum where the most dangerous mages of old would be held. Spellhold is strictly off-limits to all, but strange lights have been spotted from the mainland. So the Council of Five, rulers of Amn, have allowed access to a very select few—including the players! Heroes will have to navigate the demands and desires of Amn's most powerful factions while searching for the secret truth of Spellhold.

*Showdown in Spellhold* is designed as a one-shot introduction to Amn and its factions and provides new heroes with opportunities to form relationships that can lead to an ongoing campaign. With your purchase you will receive:

- A one-shot adventure for Tier 1 (levels 1-4) characters
- Two custom illustrated maps
