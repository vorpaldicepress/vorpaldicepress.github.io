## Vagrant in Wonderland

Vagrant in Wonderland is a whimsical Alice-esque journey into the depths of Araumycos, the Great Fungus. The characters encounter Vagrant, an intrepid myconid scout living within Araumycos who is looking for outside help for a great crisis that has befallen their colony – vast parts of Araumycos are dying and they do not know why or how to stop it. When the party accepts Vagrant’s plea for help, they are led underground through a secret passage. There’s one catch: Vagrant uses the shrinking pygmywort mushroom to get them all inside – but they have no matching bigwig mushrooms left to restore them to their actual size again! The party soon discovers that the mystery of the dying colony and a fresh source for bigwig mushrooms may be closely linked…
