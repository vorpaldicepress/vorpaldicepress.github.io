> [..] those who do dwell in and near marshes will tell you of their bounty, from fish and frogs for the cooking-fire to reeds for thatching roofs, and bog-muck that makes crops grow with almost frightening speed and vigor to a rich array of abundant, life-saving medicinal plants—to say nothing of herbs for dishes bound for even the finest dining tables. So, sparsely-tapped wells of bounty that are best stayed well away from.
> - Ed Greenwood (excerpt from Foreword)

The sixth in a multipart series exploring the eight biomes of Dungeons & Dragons within the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.

**Swamps of the Realms** explores the icky yet bountiful biome of swamps. In our travels, we've found new and old flora, fauna, and history to bring to you about the fens and mires of the Realms. Swamps of the Realms does this through both narrative prose, written from the perspective of Amarune Whitewave (the great, great granddaughter of Elminster Aumar), and through occasional notes from her husband, editor, and traveling companion Arclath Delcastle.

### Contained with this 56-page tome, you'll get:

#### Subclasses
- the Circle of the Fen druid which seeks to expand on the land (swamp) druid.
- and the Bogshadow, a conclave of Rangers who linger in the darkness of swamps, prepared to strike with all the land's vitriol.

#### Variant rules
Expansions to the Druid and Ranger classes to allow them more access to the new spells contained within this book!

#### Spells!
10 brand new spells: each using a new spellcasting component, Environment, as they each rely on the boons of the world around them.

+1 bonus spell, druidic practice, which is the Druid version of the ceremony spell for Clerics.

#### Items!
10 magic items: forged in stone and tempered under the weight of the world.

#### Creatures!
11 monsters: new creatures for Wild Shaping, mounts, and companions!

#### Flora!
21 flora: the thriving bounty of the swamps. Roots, lichens, and hearty plants that you can collect and use to create all manner of items, as well as improve some spells.

#### Downtime Activities!
A gathering expedition specifically designed to find and collect the flora described in this book.

#### Location Stories
Straight from the journal of Amarune Whitewave herself, stories of their expeditions into five notable Faerûn deserts:
- The Evermoors
- Flooded Forest
- Great Swamp of Rethlid
- Mere of Dead Men
- Vast Swamp

#### Cartography!
A map of Faerûn: Updated for 5th Edition, this book contains a two-page map of Faerûn covering the Sword Coast all the way to the Plains of Purple Dust

*Also included is a separate high-resolution PDF of the map in both colored and Printer Friendly, available to print on 8.5"x11" or 11"x17"*

#### Art!
Journal-style sketch art by Shiah "Cinder" Irgangladen and Nathanaël Roux and several other full color pieces throughout the book, combined with a field-journal document style, complete with spilled ink

#### ... Last but not Least!

Content and a foreword written by the creator of Forgotten Realms, Ed Greenwood, himself.
