During the Glorious Revolution, the genie warlords commanding Calimshan were overthrown--but their legacy remains. A ruin deep in the Calim Desert has been uncovered, and adventurers are needed to venture into its depths! Beyond the traps and creatures inside, the mighty efreeti Lord Jhakiz is awakening. Will the adventurers be able to survive the Prison of Lord Jhakiz?  
_The Prison of Lord Jhakiz_ is a one-shot adventure designed as an introduction to Calimshan. While it stands alone, it also functions to kick off an entire campaign based in Calimshan! With your purchase you will receive:

*   A one-shot adventure for Tier 1 (levels 1-4) characters
*   6 custom maps, plus DM and player variants
*   A dark "dusk" version, a light "dawn" version, and a printer-friendly version of the document

This adventure is part of the Player Primer series, which helps build characters that feel grounded in a region. The adventure stands alone, but for the best experience pick up _Player Primer: Calimshan!_
