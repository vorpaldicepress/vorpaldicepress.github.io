Grazilaxx's Guide to Aquatic Ancestries converts some of the most popular water-based races into the ground-breaking, best selling system Grazilaxx's Guide to Ancestry -- a modular, customizable race-building system that gets rid of the baggage of the core system.

#### Included in this product

A quick summary of the "Grazilaxx System" (you don't have to buy the original).

Ten water-based races from five different authors:

- Aboling
- Bullywug
- Deepfolk
- Crawfolk
- Koalinth
- Krakin
- Kuo-Toa
- Merchild
- Octopods
- Pahari
