<center>Amarune's Adventures is a series of short 3-6 hour adventures that explore the various locations detailed in the best selling <a href="#amarune#">Amarune's Almanac</a> series.</center>
## Terror in the Ice
<center><b>The adventure also includes suggestions for incorporating it into the official artic-set adventures such as Storm King’s Thunder and Rime of the Frostmaiden, as well as into your own campaigns.</b></center>

The Faraway Explorers are a company of treasure hunters currently operating out of the city of Luskan. They have recently discovered the ruins of an ancient fortress of the giants called Knorlfesting, located on an uncharted island in the Sea of Moving Ice. During a successful expedition to explore the ruins, so many artifacts of historical significance and value were discovered that they could not fit on the expedition ship to bring back.

Upon returning to Luskan, a second expedition was quickly mounted to pick up the remaining artifacts. In addition to the Erebos—the company’s own ship—a former pirate ship called the Terror of Ten Towns was leased and retrofitted for the icebound journey.

Along with a sailing crew and the members of the exploration company, a number of adventurers were hired on to assist the expedition.

An uneventful outbound journey allowed for the safe loading of the remaining artifacts into the ships’ cargo holds and the two ships set out on the return journey across the Sea of Moving Ice.
