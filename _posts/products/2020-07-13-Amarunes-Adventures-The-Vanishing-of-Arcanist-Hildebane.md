## The Vanishing of Arcanist Hildebane

On the fringes of the forest known as Tangled Trees, arcanists and scholars mount expeditions into the inhospitable overgrowth from their basecamp at Survey Site 801. Their mission: to study the strange, twisted flora and assess if the abandoned forest can be tamed and inhabited by civilized races once again. When one of the famed arcanists, Eloris Hildebane, goes missing, the party is dispatched to find and recover Hildebane alive or dead.
