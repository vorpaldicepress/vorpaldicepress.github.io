<center>Amarune's Adventures is a series of short 3-6 hour adventures that explore the various locations detailed in the best selling <a href="#amarune#">Amarune's Almanac</a> series.</center>
## The Ghosts of the Glimmersea
An expedition was lost in the Glimmersea. The famous explorers, the Loxers, abruptly stopped communicating, sparking concern in those familiar with them. Maer, the merchant who originally hired the expedition, has grown worried and decided to hire a group of adventurers to check on the Loxers.

This quest will be lonely and dangerous, the Glimmersea is known for that. Can the hired adventurers find out what happened to the Loxers? Can they avoid the same fate befalling them in this adventure for four 5th- to 10th- level characters?
