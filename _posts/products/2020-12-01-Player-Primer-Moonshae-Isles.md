Across the Sea of Swords, the mysterious and myth-shrouded Moonshae Isles lie. Faerie courts hide in mystic forests and tribal kings battle lycanthropes and the bloody vampire queen. All this and more is waiting to be discovered in Player Primer: Moonshae Isles!

This supplement includes everything a DM and players need to start and run and campaign set in the Moonshae Isles, including:

- Life in Moonshae Isles
- Important events
- Regions & cities
- Factions
- New & adapted backgrounds
- A map of the Moonshae Isles
- A Character Chronicle system to build characters that feel firmly grounded in the Moonshae Isles

Our Character Chronicle, adapted from the Heroic Chronicle created in *Explorerâ€™s Guide to Wildemount*, is a system of character creation that helps players create characters with strong ties to the Moonshae Isles. This includes goals, secrets, and even favorite foods! Useful for any player, this system can also be used to create more fully-realized villains for your campaign.
