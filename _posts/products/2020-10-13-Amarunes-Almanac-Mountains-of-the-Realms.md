> To most folk of the “civilized” Realms, mountains are walls: no-go areas prone to avalanches, roamed by fearsome monsters, and beset by frigid winds and, at their loftiest heights, perpetual ice and snow. The usually rare passes through mountains are vital trade routes—and dangerous gaps invading armies pour through. [..] Perhaps mountains are worth visiting, and not just gazing at. This tome may help make such visits survivable.
> - Ed Greenwood (excerpt from Foreword)

The seventh in a multipart series exploring the eight biomes of Dungeons & Dragons within the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.

**Mountains of the Realms** explores the imposing monuments of the distant horizon. In our travels, we've found new and old flora, fauna, and history to bring to you about the taller-than-the-horizon regions of the Realms. Mountains of the Realms does this through both narrative prose, written from the perspective of Amarune Whitewave (the great, great granddaughter of Elminster Aumar), and through occasional notes from her husband, editor, and traveling companion Arclath Delcastle.

### Contained with this 53-page tome, you'll get:

#### Subclasses
- the Circle of the Standing Stones druid which seeks to expand on the land (mountain) druid.
- and the Wyvern Knight, a conclave of Rangers who ally with one of the mountain's finest hunters.

#### Variant rules
Expansions to the Druid and Ranger classes to allow them more access to the new spells contained within this book!

#### Spells!
10 brand new spells: each using a new spellcasting component, Environment, as they each rely on the boons of the world around them.

+1 bonus spell, druidic practice, which is the Druid version of the ceremony spell for Clerics.

#### Items!
10 magic items: forged in stone and tempered under the weight of the world.

#### Creatures!
16 monsters: new creatures for Wild Shaping, mounts, and companions!

#### Flora!
20 flora: the unexpectedly abundant bounty of the tall peaks. Roots, lichens, and hearty plants that you can collect and use to create all manner of items, as well as improve some spells.

#### Downtime Activities!
A gathering expedition specifically designed to find and collect the flora described in this book.

#### Location Stories
Straight from the journal of Amarune Whitewave herself, stories of their expeditions into five notable Faerûn deserts:
- Earthspur Mountains
- Mount Hotenow
- Spine of the World
- Storm Horns
- Walls of Halruaa

#### Cartography!
A map of Faerûn: Updated for 5th Edition, this book contains a two-page map of Faerûn covering the Sword Coast all the way to the Plains of Purple Dust

*Also included is a separate high-resolution PDF of the map in both colored and Printer Friendly, available to print on 8.5"x11" or 11"x17"*

#### Art!
Journal-style sketch art by Shiah "Cinder" Irgangladen and Nathanaël Roux and several other full color pieces throughout the book, combined with a field-journal document style, complete with spilled ink

#### ... Last but not Least!

Content and a foreword written by the creator of Forgotten Realms, Ed Greenwood, himself.
