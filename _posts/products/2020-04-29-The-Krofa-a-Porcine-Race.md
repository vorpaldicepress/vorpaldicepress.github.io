Presented here by Steve Fidler and Nathanaël Roux is the K'rofa race! A race of hardworking dreamers, based on the porcine familly: pig, boars and warthogs! With their 3 subraces and 4 exclusives magic items, the cleriswine, nobioar, and bellator will be right at home in your adventures!

Above the skies, far beyond the clouds, ride the k’rofa upon their skyships. They are aeronauts and closer to the heaven’s than any terrestrial race. Aboard these floating city-ships they toil away, nearly oblivious of the world below them. Much of their culture revolves around building and maintaining these ships as the survival of their race is contingent on them. Creativity, and the ingenuity to solve problems faster than they arrive, is a prized skill among k’rofa and their culture is a meritocracy that rewards such talent above all others.
