The Variant Fighter by Vorpal Dice Press acts as a bridge for groups who love the flavorful combat options of battlemaster maneuvers but donâ€™t want to always be a battlemaster on every character they play. Presented here are a variety of battlemaster maneuvers, and new maneuvers, reformatted and balanced to work as a base class feature for the Fighter class.

In addition to these base class maneuvers, there are subclass specific maneuvers for many fighter archetypes, and a Tactician subclass to replace the lost Battlemaster.
