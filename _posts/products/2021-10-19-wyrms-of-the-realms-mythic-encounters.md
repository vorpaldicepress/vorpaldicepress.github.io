**33 Dragons of Myth and Legend!**

Awaken these ancient beings and watch the panic and chaos ensue as they fly over your campaign! These dragons each appeared in the articles "Wyrms of the North" or "Wyrms of the Realms" from Dragon Magazine and are making their fifth edition appearances in this hefty tome!

- 29 Dragons from Dragon Magazine: metallic, chromatic, and gem dragons!
- Mythic statistics for Bahamut and Tiamat: the dragon gods have come to your campaign and only the worthiest of characters can test their mettle.
- A never-before seen dragon created by the sage Ed Greenwood: The Ghost Wyrm Orothdroun. This original dragon was created for the magazine, but has never been seen until now!
- Rewards galore! Mythic magic items, spells, and boons as rewards for heroes and villains with the skill and bravery to face mythic encounters!
