First introduced in *Mythic Odyssey's of Theros*, a **Mythic Encounter** is an optional rule you can apply to a creature which increases the difficulty. This takes the form of a Mythic Trait, which triggers most often on reducing the creature to 0 hit points. After which, it transforms, musters its strength, or exposes a new objective—extending the fight and unlocking new powers and abilities for the creature.

In Mythic Encounters, we bring that mechanic to all your old favorite creatures!
