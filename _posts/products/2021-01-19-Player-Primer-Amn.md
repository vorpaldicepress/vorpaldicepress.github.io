While Amn is one of the wealthiest regions of the Forgotten Realms, it is also one of the most corrupt. Here, coin rules over all. Traders from across the Sword Coast flock to Amn, bringing untold riches and treasures but forming a wealth gap that oppresses the poor. Magic is outlawed; only those loyal to the governing Council of Five may practice the mystic arts. Yet beneath the surface, hope stirs: there are those among the populace working in the shadows to change Amn and bring its corruption to light.

This supplement contains everything a DM and players need to begin a campaign set in Amn including:

- Life in Amn
- Important events
- Regions & cities
- Factions
- New & adapted backgrounds
- A map of Amn
- A Character Chronicle system to build characters that feel grounded in Amn

Our Character Chronicle, adapted from the Heroic Chronicle created in *Explorerâ€™s Guide to Wildemount*, is a system of character creation that helps players create characters with strong ties to Amn. This includes goals, secrets, and even favorite foods! Useful for any player, this system can also be used to create more fully-realized villains for your campaign.
