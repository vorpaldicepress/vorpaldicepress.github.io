The Lower Planes teem with twisted creatures just waiting to be set loose. In this supplement you will find the following:

- 5 Villains

- 2 Lairs

- **57 monsters**, ranging from CR 1/2 to CR 20

- Lore on disease in the Blood War as well as a new disease, Hellish Fever.

Everything comes with accompanying lore and original art designed to tell the story of each entry.

Use these new elements to enrich your *Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus* or *Out of the Abyss* campaign. Or, if you’re feeling particularly fiendish, unleash them on the Material Plane where dwell your unsuspecting party of adventurers.
