### A brand new class for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition
The Prism bring a unique gameplay experience to the table. A prism has a pool of **influence** that restores at the start of each turn in combat, and increases in size steadily as they level. This influence is the fuel for their basic actions - called Projections - each turn and can be spent while using a projection to alter the emotional state of a target. This is done to both punish enemies and to bolster allies.

#### The Magic of Light
Most of a prism's magic is focused on the manipulation of light, energy, and emotions. As a prism grows in power, they specialize into an aspect of the light known as a facet--a single way of interacting with the prismatic world. Some specialize in manifesting hardened light into weapons and tools. Some seek to manipulate the ambient light of the area around them to align everyone to the same emotions. Others selfishly seek to drain the light from the world around them to bolster their own radiance.

#### Testimonials
> [...] I've seen the prism. I hate the idea of adding more and more classes to the game when the archetype system exists. But if a player asked me to use the prism, I'd say yes. I see no reason it should be a single archetype so it works as a full class. It is (to my eye) balanced as heck, it's thematic (which is important in D&D, if your supplement can't add to the narrative then it falls flat to me), and it's well composed. Nothing about it feels rushed. It shows that it's a labor of love, time, and effort. It's good content.

> Mechanically? It's pretty [bleep] awesome. Thematically? It's flavorful as hell, and what it does is very clear.
> ACOG_Muffin @ Discord of Many Things

> A unique concept executed well. Prism introduces a new light-weight magic system with a lot of potential for expressive characters and new stories.
> Izzy @ Discord of Many Things

> It feels good, it reads well, I was jazzed about the influence progression and and core mechanics for projections and barriers.
