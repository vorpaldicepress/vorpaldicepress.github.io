First introduced in *Mythic Odyssey's of Theros*, a **Mythic Encounter** is an optional rule you can apply to a creature which increases the difficulty. This takes the form of a Mythic Trait, which triggers most often on reducing the creature to 0 hit points. After which, it transforms, musters its strength, or exposes a new objective—extending the fight and unlocking new powers and abilities for the creature.

When *Mythic Odyssey's of Theros* launched, we released <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/315637/Mythic-Encounters?affiliate_id=1713687">Mythic Encounters</a> - a collection of 36 CR 21+ monsters from the official D&D books updated with as a Mythic Encounter, complete with lore, art, and rewards.

In Mythic Eberron, we bring that mechanic to all your favorite EBERRON creatures!
