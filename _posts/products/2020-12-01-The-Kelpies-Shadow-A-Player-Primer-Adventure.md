Welcome to the Moonshae Isles. On this mysterious and magical series of islands, myth becomes real. One such myth is taking its toll on Barret's Quay: ancient artifacts of protection have been stolen, and haunting creatures of myth have begun to menace the villagers. Adventurers are needed to recover these artifacts and uncover the mystery behind their theft.

*The Kelpie's Shadow* is a mystery with one of several possible culprits. This one-shot adventure is designed to introduce players to the themes of the Moonshae Isles and provide hooks for an ongoing campaign. With your purchase you will receive:

- A one-shot adventure for Tier 1 (levels 1-4) characters
- Two custom illustrated maps
