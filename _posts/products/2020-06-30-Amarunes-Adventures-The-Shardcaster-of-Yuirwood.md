## The Shardcaster of Yuirwood

Aglarond, on the southeastern edge of the Sea of Fallen Stars, is a nation of human merchants and ancient elves. The sprawling Yuirwood also houses the greatest population of half-elves in all the Realms. Since the death of Simbul, Aglarond has been under attack by the Red Wizards of Thay to the east, the Abolethic Sovereignty from far beyond, and incursions from the Feywild within the ancient Yuirwood. The few Star Elves that once called Yuir home have found their new cosmology adjacent to attack from mysterious sorcerers known as Nilshai, and this conflict overflows into the Yuirwood itself.

This adventure draws inspiration from the third edition adventure <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/51649/The-Twilight-Tomb-35?affiliate_id=1713687">The Twilight Tomb</a> as well as Bruce Cordell’s <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Stardeep-Dungeons-Bruce-R-Cordell/dp/0786943386">Stardeep</a>, which introduces and explores the Star Elves and their relationship to Yuirwood.
