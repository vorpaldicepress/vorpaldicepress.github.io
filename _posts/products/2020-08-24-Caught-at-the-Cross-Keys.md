> Solid one-shot adventure! Great as a interlude or prelude for any campaign, not just the Sword Coast! Now go rescue/kidnap that noble!

#### A two hour adventure for 2nd - 4th level characters

## Emerson Frostfield has been Kidnapped!

The young, wealthy, and extremely obnoxious noble has been talking very loudly about the money his family has. The party will have to head to the Cross Keys Inn on the High Road south of Neverwinter and bring him back unharmed.

However, The Cross Keys attracts many folks all with their own agendas… Crazed drunken goliaths, street gangs, thugs, and adventurers from all over Faerun are all thrown in to make for one wild night at the Inn!

This adventure gives players the option to be the heroes and save the day or play another group of bandits looking to capitalise on the work of others!


Each purchase comes with the following:
- 13 page adventure
- 3 new magic items
- 7 new or modified stat blocks for NPCs
- Printable maps
- NPC player handouts

**Content warning:** Kidnapping. Violence. Gangs. Alcohol use. Death.
