### HARK! HEED ME NOW FOR THE TIME OF THE KRAKIN IS HERE.

Now that I have your attention, plug your nose, take a breath, and dive right in.

This supplement is the perfect companion for the *Ghosts of Saltmarsh*, *Tomb of Annihilation*, and any waterborne adventure of your own design.

Introducing the **Krakin** race! A pact-born race, not unlike the fiendish Tieflings. Their progenitor however is the mythical Kraken! These tentacular, scaled, otherwise dashing creatures dot the secluded coasts of the Forgotten Realms. They exist in small communities known as Collectives - operating as fishing villages and trading ports for other waterborne races. While not as xenophobic as some races, most collectives that include non-Krakin races are limited to other waterborne races such as the Sea Elves, Merrow, Merfolk, and Tritons.

Also included in this document are **two variant races** for the Krakin - **Sea Spawn** and the **Locathah**. These staples of the Forgotten Realms can serve as a more villanous option or aid in integrating this document into your games.

But that's not all the deep abyss has in store for you. This supplement also includes a **racial feat** specifically for races that call water home, and a **1st-level** spell for Wizards, Sorcerers, and the Krakin race themselves.

Of course, this magic can also be gifted to a Warlock via the **Denizen of the Depths** patron! A warlock subclass for those who create pacts with the Kraken, or other deep sea beasts such as the Leviathan, Dragon Turtles, Iakhovas, or even Umberlee herself.

Speaking of Umberlee, what of the devout worshippers of the Bitch Queen herself? The **Sea Domain** clerics of course! Bring the tide to the mainland and wash away the sins of the earth as a Cleric of Umberlee.

Featuring cover art from the wonderful and talented Lluis Abadias, spot art from Matt Marrow and others, and the document stylings of Vorpal Dice Press.
