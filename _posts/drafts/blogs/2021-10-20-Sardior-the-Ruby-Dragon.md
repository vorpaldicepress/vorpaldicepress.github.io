#### Written by Bryan Holmes

<br />

While the great chromatic and metallic dragons wage battles and intrigue, sometimes in the name of Bahamut or Tiamat, the gem dragons are content with more philosophical ways, enjoying contemplation and meditation. While Tiamat lords over chromatic dragons with an iron claw, and Bahamut inspires goodness in his followers, most gem dragons don’t pay all that much mind to Sardior: the ruby dragon. 

Sardior is the creator of gem dragons, although where he came from is unknown. Some say a ruby coalesced in the elemental chaos or the far realms, growing until it became touched by divinity where it grew into an egg and eventually Sardior hatched fully formed.

Sardior is playful, enjoying intellectual exercises with other creatures. He also possesses a sharp wit, and is an infamous conversationalist. At the height of Netheril, Sardior considered the wizards to be sometimes allies and sometimes foes, although always a group to count on when going against the Phaerimm. Today, he is more concerned with proliferating psionic power within all the races of the world.

**Ideal.** “Leave the world a better place than it was when you entered it.”

**Bond.** “The world is full of arcane and divine… it needs more powers of the mind to balance them out.”

**Flaw.** “My ascension to divinity makes it easy to understand the big picture, but hard to see the impact on individuals.”

> DMs wanting to know more about Sardior should check out the following books: “That’s not in the Monster Manual” from *Dragon* #37,  *Planes of Law*, and “The Legend of Sardior, The Mind’s Eye” from the *Wizards of the Coast website* (found <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psm/20030124a">here</a>)

#### Editor's Note:
While not Bryan's intention, while reading this over I couldn't help but think of <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Niv-Mizzet">Niv Mizzet</a>, from the Magic: the Gathering world of Ravnica. Sardior's statblock, as presented below, could be used for Niv Mizzet if you are using the setting guide *Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica*! Bonus!

### Sardior’s Lair
The Ruby Palace is a flying castle which travels the material plane high above the world. Clouds generate around the castle as threads of the astral plane boil away around the fortress. If the palace remains in place for at least one week, the regional effects of the castle begin to spread out at a rate of 1 mile per day, to a maximum of 8 miles.

***Lair Actions.*** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Sardior can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Sardior changes gravity, replicating the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/reverse-gravity">reverse gravity</a> spell except he can orient the area in any direction, causing creatures and objects within to fall toward the end of the area.
- Sardior shapes the walls or floor of his castle into an object, replicating the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/stone-shape">stone shape</a> spell.
- Sardior can channel energy through his castle, healing one other creature Sardior can see. That creature regains 15 hit points.

***Regional Effects.*** The region containing Sardior’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:
- Sardior is aware of the number of minds in his region with intelligences above 3, and those with intelligences below 3. Sardior is not aware of creatures with the Undead, Construct, Ooze, or Plant type.
- Bodies of water at least 10 feet in diameter become Color Pools as described in chapter 2 of the *Dungeon Masters Guide*.
- Clouds within the region become connected to the astral plane.  When a creature spends at least 1 minute within a cloud, when they leave the cloud roll 1d20. On a 19 or 20, they exit in the astral plane. 

### Sardior as a Mythic Encounter
Sardior is a powerful encounter on his own, but if the adventurers want a true challenge fit for the gods, you can use his [Mythic Trait] trait. Using this trait marks a drastic turn in the encounter as [very short description of what occurs]. Once Sardior has used this trait, he can choose one of his mythic actions when he uses a legendary action.
Read or paraphrase the following text when Sardior uses his [Mythic Trait] trait:

> Description, in italics, detailing what occurs when the Mythic Trait triggers

#### Rewards
Fighting Sardior as a mythic encounter is equivalent to fighting two challenge 30 creatures in one encounter. Award a party 310,000 XP for defeating Sardior after he uses [Mythic Trait]. You can also reward them with <a href="#ruby-of-free-thought">Ruby of Free Thought</a> and the spell [spell reward 1, spell reward 2] in addition to any other treasure he might hold.

<div class="hanging">

***Multiattack.*** Sardior can use his Frightful Presence. He then makes four attacks: one with his bite, one with his tail and two with his claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 25 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (4d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** Sardior uses one of the following breath weapons:

*Concussive Breath.* Sardior exhales concussive force in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures reduced to 0 hit points by this breath weapon are not dying and instead are stabilized automatically.

*Blazing Radiance.* Sardior exhales a blast of radiant fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) fire damage and 31 (7d8) radiant damage.
	
***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Sardior’s choice that is within 240 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Sardior's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

</div>

### Bonus Actions

<div class="hanging">

***Quick Breath.*** Sardior attempts to recharge his breath weapon.

</div>

### Legendary Actions

Sardior can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Sardior regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

<div class="hanging">

***Express Psionics (Variable cost).*** Sardior casts one of his innate psionics. At will powers use 1 legendary action. 3/day use 2 legendary actions. 1/day use 3 legendary actions.

***Hardened Scales (Costs 2 actions).*** Sardior hardens his scales, reinforcing them with mental fortitude. The next time Sardior takes damage before the start of his next turn, he has resistance to all damage that turn and this effect ends.

***Wing Attack.*** Sardior beats his wings. Each creature within 15 feet of Sardior must succeed on a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw or take 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Sardior can then fly up to half his flying speed.

</div>

### Mythic Actions

If Sardior is a Mythic encounter, he can choose from the options below as additional legendary actions while [condition, usually thp from trait]:

<div class="hanging">

***Dive Bomb. (Costs 2 actions).*** Sardior moves up to half his flying speed away from the ground. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. At the start of his next turn, Sardior immediately plummets directly towards the ground, creating a large shockwave in a sphere with a radius of 5 feet for every 5 feet of movement Sardior plummeted. Each creature within this sphere must succeed on a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 15 feet directly away from Sardior. Creatures who succeed on this saving throw instead are only pushed 5 feet directly away from Sardior and not knocked prone unless that movement causes them to collide with a creature or structure.

***Telekinetic Throw.*** Sardior’s eyes glow bright blue. Before the end of his next turn, when Sardior uses the multiattack action, as a bonus action he can cast <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/telekinesis">telekinesis</a>.

***Reflective Scales.*** Sardior’s scales shift and twist like prisms. As a reaction before the start of his next turn, whenever a spell is cast on Sardior and he succeeds on his saving throw, Sardior can choose one creature that he can see who is a valid target for the spell and it is cast upon them instead.

</div>

## Rewards
Below are spells and magical items you can reward your party for defeating Sardior, the Ruby Dragon.

### Ruby of Free Thought
*Wondrous item, mythic (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

One of the many ruby scales that comprise Sardior’s tough exterior that gleams brighter and more radiant than the others. This scale—which could easily be mistaken for a gemstone—can impart powerful psionic power to a spellcaster who chooses to attune to it.

***Psionics.*** When you attune to the ruby, your mind begins to race at a pace previously unknown to you. You gain the ability to cast some of your spells without expending spell slots or using components.

<div class="spelllist">

At Will: *Any 1st-level spell you know.*

3/day: *Any spell you know up to 5th-level.*

1/day: *Any spell you know up to 9th-level.*

</div>

***Empty Mind.*** While attuned to the scale, you are always under the effects of the spell <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mind-blank/">mind blank</a>. If a spell or effect would attempt to sense your emotions or read your thoughts, you can choose to share any information you’d like, or nothing at all.

***Sentience.*** The Ruby of Free Thought is a sentient object of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 30, Wisdom of 26, and Charisma of 29. It has hearing and blindsight out to a range of 300 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature within that range.

***Personality.*** The ruby, while sentient, does not contain Sardior’s true mind but instead a sort of pseudo-intelligence designed to share specific information with whomever it attunes to. It instructs its bearer on psionic teachings and practices, and will take any opportunity to lead the bearer back to the Ruby Palace, or to a nearby gem dragon who can assist in reaching the palace. It harbors no ill will towards its bearer and will share whatever information it can to help protect them, but its ultimate goal is to be reunited with Sardior.

***Destroying the Ruby.*** The ruby is a powerful artifact, immune to the effects of all traditional forms of damage. To destroy the ruby, it must be brought to a hidden location within the Ruby Palace: the chamber where Sardior keeps the fragments of the egg from which he hatched.
